# Dynamic forms

We want to present a reactive form with a select element.

The select element should contain choices for your favorite web framework. The choices are: 'Angular', 'React', 'Vue' and 'Ember'.

If someone selects a choice other than 'Angular' we should display a field for them to type the reason why they didn't select Angular.

Each field in the form is required. The reason field should only be displyed when the user doesn't select Angular.

On save, the form should log its value to the console.
